Circles
Name
Date
This program has a class called Circle, which is used
to represent circles. Currently, the class is missing
two methods: calculateArea() and calculateCircumference().
The first, calculateArea(), should calculate the area of
a circle. The second, caluclateCircumference(), should
calculate the circumference (perimeter) of a circle. Write
these two methods.
Once you have written the methods, create two Circle objects
in main(), cirlce1 and circle2, with a radius of 4 and a
radius of 5.5 respectively. Call both the calculateArea() and
calculateCircumference() methods for each object and display
the results in the console.
